# ATM-Simulation-System-Using-C-language

This is an ATM simulation project. It is basically an interface for the ATM system.
Initially U have to enter your card number ( i.e. ( 1234 ) and can't be changed ) . if u enter wrong card number , then it will again ask for card number.
Then you have to enter ur card pin ( i.e. 8923 and can be change ). if u enter wrong card pin then it will ask again and again .
If all the above queries are proper . then a menu of 6 option will arise. 1. to deposit money 2. to withdraw money 3. to check balance 4. to change pin 5. to get help 6. exit u can do any of these operations ….. I hope u will surely enjoy the program as I have used ( functions, logics, loops, conditions, goto Statement, delay, sound effects, and many others features) . Try Run this program in turbo c++ HOPE u will enjoy...….Happy Coding's :)
